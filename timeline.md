## 🧱 **Phase 1: Core Engine (Weeks 1–3)**  
*Goal: Detect, verify, and safely trade new meme coins*

### **Milestones**
| Task | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1.1 Deploy `$SIGIL` SPL token (mint authority revoked) | Blockchain Dev | Token mint address, Raydium LP |
| 1.2 Build on-chain safety checker (5-point rug scan) | Trading Engineer | `isTokenSafe(mint)` function |
| 1.3 Integrate Helius WebSocket for new token detection | Backend Dev | Real-time stream of pump.fun → Raydium mints |
| 1.4 Implement basic trade execution (Jupiter API + Jito) | Trading Engineer | `/trade/buy` endpoint |
| 1.5 Build Trade Score engine (liquidity + holders + price) | Data Engineer | `calculateTradeScore(token)` |

> ✅ **Phase 1 MVP**: A CLI or simple dashboard that **alerts you to safe, high-score tokens** and lets you **manually buy** with one click.

---

## 🤖 **Phase 2: AI Agents (Weeks 4–5)**  
*Goal: Add autonomous research and alpha generation*

### **Milestones**
| Task | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2.1 Set up LLM router (LiteLLM + OpenAI/Gemini/Qwen) | AI Engineer | `llm_call(provider, prompt)` |
| 2.2 Build **Research Agent** (narrative scoring) | AI Engineer | Enriches tokens with `narrative_score` |
| 2.3 Build **Social Agent** (X + Telegram sentiment) | AI Engineer | Real-time `social_score` feed |
| 2.4 Integrate agent outputs into Trade Score | Full-Stack Dev | Unified token profile with AI insights |
| 2.5 Add “AI Reasoning” modal in UI (show LLM rationale) | Frontend Dev | Click any alert → see why AI flagged it |

> ✅ **Phase 2 MVP**: Your dashboard now shows **AI-powered alerts** like:  
> *“$WOOF — STRONG BUY (Score: 88) — Whale buy + Dog narrative + LP locked”*

---

## 👥 **Phase 3: Community & Monetization (Weeks 6–7)**  
*Goal: Let creators build audiences and monetize via `$SIGIL`*

### **Milestones**
| Task | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 3.1 Creator profile system (wallet-verified) | Backend Dev | `/creators/{id}` pages |
| 3.2 Subscription tiers (paid in `$SIGIL`) | Full-Stack Dev | Free / Pro ($10 = 1,000 $SIGIL) |
| 3.3 Token-gated posts (hold X $SIGIL or token) | Backend Dev | `visibility: "tier:pro"` |
| 3.4 Creator dashboard (post trades, write updates) | Frontend Dev | Rich text + trade embeds |
| 3.5 Auto-payouts to creators (weekly $SIGIL) | Blockchain Dev | Treasury → Creator transfers |

> ✅ **Phase 3 MVP**: Influencers can **claim profiles**, **post alpha**, and **earn $SIGIL** from subscribers.

## 🚀 **Phase 4: Launch & Growth (Week 8+)**  
*Goal: Go live, acquire users, and iterate*

### **Key Actions**
| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Token Distribution** | Airdrop 200M $SIGIL to early Solana traders (via snapshot) |
| **Liquidity** | Add 50M $SIGIL + 500 SOL to Raydium pool |
| **Go-to-Market** | Partner with 5 meme coin influencers for launch |
| **Feedback Loop** | Add “Was this alert useful?” thumbs up/down on AI signals |
| **Roadmap** | DAO governance (v2), mobile app (v3) |

---

## 👥 **Team Structure (Minimal Viable Team)**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **1x Blockchain Engineer** | Token, trading engine, on-chain checks |
| **1x Full-Stack Developer** | API, frontend, community features |
| **1x AI/ML Engineer** | Agents, LLM integration, scoring |
| **1x Product Designer** | UI/UX, dashboard, creator flows |
| **You (Founder)** | Tokenomics, partnerships, roadmap |

> 💡 **You can start with 2 engineers** (blockchain + full-stack) and outsource AI initially.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Summary**

| Layer | Technology |
|------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, Tailwind, Zustand |
| **Backend** | NestJS (TS), Python (AI) |
| **AI** | LiteLLM, Qwen/OpenAI/Gemini, Qdrant (optional) |
| **Blockchain** | @solana/web3.js, @jup-ag/api, Helius SDK |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Prisma), Redis |
| **Infra** | AWS (EKS, Secrets Manager), Docker |
| **Monitoring** | Datadog, Prometheus |

---

## 💰 **Cost Estimates (First 3 Months)**

| Category | Cost |
|--------|------|
| **Cloud (AWS)** | $800/mo |
| **LLM APIs** | $300–$600/mo (10k tokens/day) |
| **RPC (Helius Pro)** | $200/mo |
| **Team (2 engineers)** | ~$20k/mo (contractors) |
| **Total** | **~$22k–$25k** for MVP |

> 🌱 **Bootstrappable**: Start with open-source stack + lean team.

## 📌 **Immediate Next Actions (This Week)**

1. **✅ Deploy `$SIGIL` token** (use [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/mint-token) or [Metaplex Candy Machine](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/overview))
2. **✅ Set up Helius WebSocket** for pump.fun mints (free tier available)
3. **✅ Build `isTokenSafe()` function** (use code from earlier guide)
4. **✅ Create Figma wireframe** of dashboard (token list + AI insights)
5. **✅ Reach out to 3 meme coin influencers** for Phase 3 partnership

## 🎯 Final Thought

You’re not building “just another sniper bot.”  
You’re building the **central nervous system for Solana meme culture** — where **safety**, **intelligence**, **community**, and **economics** converge.
